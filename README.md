# Project Planner
Project Planner is an organization tool for those budgeting for important events. Add line items to your budget, drag them to prioritize or group them by category, edit, approve, or delete them. Thanks to an integration with the Google API, you can log in using OAuth and export your projects to Google Sheets for additional customization.

This project uses Javascript for dynamic page interaction along with the Draggable JS library for the drag actions.

Project Planner is a collaborative effort by Adit Patel and Mike Diaz.
